# VORefinementLSTM
Refinement Net to improve odometry Estimate output by traditional odometry


## Overview

The repository contains implementation of Refinement to refine odmetry of an autonomous vehicle. The repository assuumes that initial estimates from the monocular visual odometry are available for the sequence. The sequence of recorded images and corresponding intrinsic matrix for building monocular odometry pipleine have been taken from KITTI Dataset.

The code for monocular odometry is this repository:
